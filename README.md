Image scaling using nearest neighbor algorithm 

Write a code that scales images using nearest neighbor algorithm. S factor, one used for scaling. Is inserted from standard input and is always greater than or equal to 1. After reading S factor from standard input, in a certain way (freedom of choice for this is left to student to decide), also using standard input, user defines whether he wants to increase or decimate dimension of the image S times.
